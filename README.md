<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Grouds</h1>
 
<strong>Description</strong>

Grouds (a nonsensical word arising from a mispelling in the word "Ground" on creating this project) is, as it currently stands, a tile-based game in which the player is tasked with controlling various entities in order to, well, survive. As of right now, the project is a little bit "bare bones" (frameworks created, though systems not very fleshed out). At least it's not a text adventure!

<strong>Interaction</strong>

In this project, I aimed to break away from my usual trend of creating exclusively text adventures. Thus, Grouds is a tile-based map, traversed via clicking. Hovering over tiles prints their information out to the HUD, while clicking on a tile will keep the information on screen, showing the player the clicked tile, data of that tile. While unimplemented as of yet, the game itself will be traversable via the control of an "Entity" (a human), which can move between tiles, garner resources from them in certain cases (trees give wood, rocks give stone...), and craft! 

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

This project is written in C++ with the usage of openFrameworks, a cross-platform visual toolkit designed for interfacing with Xcode. The library can be found on their website, <a href = "http://openframeworks.cc/download/">here</a>, or directly from its <a href="https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks">Github Repository</a>. 

However, it can also be launched directly via the Debug.app, bypassing the need for openFrameworks (or Xcode). Go nuts!

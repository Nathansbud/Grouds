<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: ???</h1>
 
<strong>Description</strong>

[Project Name] is...well, it is what it is, yo. Unlike my previous major projectsâ€”of varying stages of completion, this project is going to take the form of a...TBD.

<strong>Interaction</strong>

While this project garners inspiration from (and, possibly, enables access to) both The Void and SchoolQuest, it will likely be navigable via typing and/or mouse presses rather, and (potentially) combat/minigames, versus the simplisitc, button-based UI of its predecessors. Instructions will be available in game, as well as a dictionairy of usable commands/modifiers (for typing sections). Try not to break things!

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

This project is written in C++ with the usage of openFrameworks, a cross-platform visual toolkit designed for interfacing with Xcode. The library can be found on their website, <a href = "http://openframeworks.cc/download/">here</a>, or directly from its <a href="https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks">Github Repository</a>.

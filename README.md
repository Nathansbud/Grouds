<h1>Unit 3 Final Project: Grouds</h1>
 
<strong>Description</strong>

Grouds (a nonsensical word arising from a mispelling in the word "Ground" on creating this project) is, as it currently stands, a tile-based game in which the player is tasked with controlling various entities in order to, well, survive. As of right now, the project is a little bit "bare bones" (frameworks created, though systems not very fleshed out). At least it's not a text adventure!

<strong>Interaction</strong>

In this project, I aimed to break away from my usual trend of creating exclusively text adventures. Thus, Grouds is a tile-based map, traversed via clicking. Hovering over tiles prints their information out to the HUD, while clicking on a tile will keep the information on screen, showing the player the clicked tile, data of that tile. While unimplemented as of yet, the game itself will be traversable via the control of an "Entity" (a human), which can move between tiles, garner resources from them in certain cases (trees give wood, rocks give stone...), and craft! 

<strong>Getting Started</strong>

This project is written in C++ with the usage of openFrameworks, a cross-platform visual toolkit designed for interfacing with Xcode. The library can be found on their website, <a href = "http://openframeworks.cc/download/">here</a>, or directly from its <a href="https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks">Github Repository</a>. 

However, it can also be launched directly via the Debug.app, bypassing the need for openFrameworks (or Xcode). Go nuts!

<strong>Reflection</strong>

As is often the case, my intial plans for the game were...a little overzealous, especially for the time of year. A combination of multiple projects, sleep deprivation, exam stress, general school fatigue, and sickness—hence why I'm writing this readme—at times, this project sort of draw the short straw when it came to work priority. As such, this project was not fully completed, though with the reduced burden of assignements that will take place shortly, I expect that I will return to finish "Milestone #3" (not at all added retroactively shh).
